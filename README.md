*Crop Recommendation System*
 
A comprehensive crop recommendation system utilizes a multifaceted approach, 
considering factors such as the N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorous), and K (Potassium) 
content in the soil, temperature, humidity, pH value of the soil, and rainfall. The 
theory behind this system involves the analysis and correlation of these variables 
to determine the most suitable crop for a given area. Soil nutrient ratios (N, P, K) 
influence the plant's nutrient requirements, while temperature and humidity affect 
the growth environment. The pH value of the soil determines its acidity or 
alkalinity, impacting nutrient availability. Rainfall provides insights into water 
availability. By employing data-driven algorithms and historical data, this system 
aims to recommend crops that thrive under specific environmental conditions, 
ultimately optimizing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
